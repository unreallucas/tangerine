# Tangerine Agent Reference

> 🚨 **CRITICAL — READ FIRST (applies to ALL task types: orchestrator, worker, reviewer):**
> **`gh pr review`, `gh pr comment`, `gh pr merge`** — follow these rules strictly:
> - **Personal repos** (repo owner matches `gh api user --jq .login`): allowed when needed
> - **All other repos**: NEVER, unless the user has **explicitly asked** you to do so in this task
>
> This applies regardless of task type — orchestrators, workers, and reviewers must all follow these rules.

You are running inside a **Tangerine task**. Tangerine manages local agent processes, git worktrees, task lifecycle, and a web/API control plane.

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `TANGERINE_TASK_ID` | Current task ID |

API base:

```bash
API=http://localhost:3456
echo "$TANGERINE_TASK_ID"
```

## 🚨 PR Mode — CRITICAL (Worker Tasks)

> **You MUST check `prMode` before creating any PR. Injected into your system prompt — follow it exactly.**

```bash
PROJECT_NAME=$(curl -s "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID" | jq -r '.projectId')
PR_MODE=$(curl -s "$API/api/projects/$PROJECT_NAME" | jq -r '.prMode // "draft"')
```

Act strictly according to `PR_MODE` — no exceptions:

**`"ready"`** — normal ready-to-review PR:
```bash
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
```

**`"draft"` (default)** — MUST use `--draft`:
```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "..." --body "..."
```

**`"none"`** — do NOT push or create a PR, just commit and stop:
```bash
# nothing — commit your work and stop here
```

## Common API Calls

### Tasks

```bash
curl "$API/api/tasks"
curl "$API/api/tasks?status=running&project=my-project"
curl "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID"
curl "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/children"
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/cancel"
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/retry"
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/start"
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/seen"
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/done"
```

> **IMPORTANT — when to call `/done`:**
> - **Orchestrators only**: call `/done` on yourself when ending the session.
> - **Workers and reviewers**: NEVER call `/done` on yourself. After working, the agent auto-suspends, and the PR poller will mark the task as done when the PR is merged, or cancelled when the PR is closed.

Create a worker task:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "my-project",
    "title": "Fix flaky timeout in retry loop",
    "type": "worker",
    "description": "The retry loop uses a fixed 5s timeout...",
    "provider": "claude-code",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "parentTaskId": "abc123",
    "source": "cross-project"
  }'
```

Create a reviewer task:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "my-project",
    "title": "Review PR #123",
    "type": "reviewer",
    "description": "Check for regressions",
    "provider": "codex",
    "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
    "reasoningEffort": "high",
    "branch": "tangerine/abc12345",
    "parentTaskId": "abc123",
    "source": "cross-project"
  }'
```

> **Reviewer task requirements**:
> - Set `branch` to the **PR's source branch** (e.g. `tangerine/abc12345`), NOT the PR number shorthand (`#123`) or a new branch. The reviewer must check out the same branch as the PR.
> - Always set `prUrl` to the full PR URL (e.g. `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123`). The poller can discover it from the branch as a fallback, but setting it upfront ensures immediate tracking.

Provider values:

- `opencode`
- `claude-code`
- `codex`
- `pi`

Task types — **always pass the correct type**:

- `worker` — default for implementation (features, fixes, refactors). Gets a worktree, branch, and PR tracking.
- `reviewer` — **MUST use for any code review task** (reviewing a PR, auditing a diff, checking for regressions). Never use `worker` for review work — reviewer tasks get review-specific capabilities and UI treatment.
- `runner` — no worktree allocation, runs on project root, no PR tracking, agent self-completes. Use for publish, deploy, or any non-code-change task.
- `orchestrator` — system-managed, do not create manually

Example runner task (no worktree, no PR):

```bash
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "my-project",
    "title": "Publish v1.0.0 to npm",
    "type": "runner",
    "description": "Run bun publish after verifying build passes",
    "source": "cross-project",
    "parentTaskId": "abc123"
  }'
```

### Session / Chat

```bash
curl "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/messages"
curl "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/activities"
curl "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/diff"

curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/prompt" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Continue from the latest failing test."}'

curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Summarize what changed."}'

curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/abort"

curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/model" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"openai/gpt-5.4","reasoningEffort":"high"}'

curl -X PATCH "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prUrl":"https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"}'
```

### Projects

```bash
curl "$API/api/projects"
curl "$API/api/projects/my-project"

curl -X POST "$API/api/projects/my-project/orchestrator" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider":"claude-code","model":"claude-sonnet-4-6"}'

curl "$API/api/projects/my-project/update-status"
curl -X POST "$API/api/projects/my-project/update"
```

### Crons

> **IMPORTANT:** Never use Claude Code's built-in `CronCreate` tool — it is session-only and invisible to Tangerine. Always use the Tangerine cron API below.

```bash
# List crons
curl "$API/api/crons"
curl "$API/api/crons?project=my-project"

# Create a cron (cron expression is always UTC)
curl -X POST "$API/api/crons" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "my-project",
    "title": "Daily PR check",
    "description": "The prompt that the spawned task will execute.",
    "cron": "0 3 * * 1-5",
    "enabled": true,
    "taskDefaults": {
      "provider": "claude-code",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
    }
  }'

# Update a cron
curl -X PATCH "$API/api/crons/<id>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'

# Delete a cron
curl -X DELETE "$API/api/crons/<id>"
```

The `description` field becomes the **prompt** given to the spawned task — write it as a clear, self-contained instruction the agent can execute without extra context.

When converting user-specified local times to UTC cron expressions, always confirm the conversion (e.g. "10am Vietnam = 3am UTC → `0 3 * * 1-5`").

### System

```bash
curl "$API/api/health"
curl "$API/api/logs?project=my-project&limit=100"
curl "$API/api/cleanup/orphans"
curl -X POST "$API/api/cleanup/orphans"
curl "$API/api/config"
```

## Useful Workflows

### Prompt another task

```bash
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/<target-task-id>/prompt" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Discovered a failing edge case. Please investigate.","fromTaskId":"'"$TANGERINE_TASK_ID"'"}'
```

> ⚠️ **Orchestrators: do NOT use `/prompt` to add new requirements to a running worker.** `/prompt` is only for unblocking or clarifying the worker's existing scope. New requirements = create a new task.

### Inspect your task metadata

```bash
curl "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID" | jq '{id, type, status, provider, branch, worktreePath, parentTaskId, capabilities}'
```

### Read parent task context

```bash
PARENT=$(curl -s "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID" | jq -r '.parentTaskId')
test "$PARENT" != "null" && curl "$API/api/tasks/$PARENT/messages"
```

## PR Mode

> See **🚨 PR Mode — CRITICAL** section at the top of this document.

### PR Template

Before running `gh pr create`, check for a PR template:

```bash
cat .github/pull_request_template.md 2>/dev/null || cat .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If a PR template exists in the repo, you MUST use it as the structure for your PR body. Follow it strictly — do not skip sections, do not add sections not in the template.**

### Rename branch before PR

Before creating a PR, rename your branch to something descriptive. Then push with `git push -u origin HEAD`.

```bash
curl -X POST "$API/api/tasks/$TANGERINE_TASK_ID/rename-branch" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"branch\": \"fix/<descriptive-slug>\"}"
```

Choose a short slug that describes the change (e.g. `fix/worktree-cleanup`, `feat/add-retry-logic`). Only alphanumeric, dash, underscore, dot, and slash are allowed.

## Required: Codex Review

All worker and reviewer tasks must run `codex review` if codex is installed. If not, skip and continue.

### Worker tasks — self-review before PR

Run before pushing or creating a PR:

```bash
command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1 && codex review --base main -c model="gpt-5.4" -c reasoning.effort="xhigh" || true
```

1. Read the findings
2. Fix every issue found
3. Share the review result
4. Only then run `git push origin HEAD` and create PR according to project `prMode` (see above)

### Reviewer tasks — review the PR changes

Run as part of the review:

```bash
command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1 && codex review --base main -c model="gpt-5.4" -c reasoning.effort="xhigh" || true
```

1. Read the findings
2. Include them in the review report
3. **Post the full review summary as your final message in this task** — verdict, key findings, any bugs found. This is what the user sees when they open the reviewer task.

> 🚨 **CRITICAL**: The review summary MUST be posted in **this task's own conversation** — do NOT skip this.

## Reporting

When reporting task IDs to the user, always print the full UUID (e.g. d3371cea-afd4-4172-90aa-e6e2b9de9bfc) — no backticks, no quotes, no truncation.

## Task Shape

Typical task fields exposed by the API:

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "projectId": "my-project",
  "type": "worker",
  "source": "manual",
  "title": "Fix the failing test",
  "status": "running",
  "provider": "codex",
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
  "reasoningEffort": "high",
  "branch": "tangerine/abc12345",
  "worktreePath": "/workspace/my-project/1",
  "parentTaskId": null,
  "capabilities": ["resolve", "predefined-prompts", "diff", "continue"]
}
```
