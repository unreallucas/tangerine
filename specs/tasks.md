# Tasks

Tasks are Tangerine's unit of work. They are backed by a DB record, a git branch, an optional worktree, a local agent process, and associated session/activity logs.

## Sources

Current `source` values:

- `manual`
- `github`
- `cross-project`

The task manager type also still accepts `"api"` internally in retry paths, but the public create route currently normalizes new tasks to `manual` or `cross-project`.

### GitHub

GitHub tasks can be created by:

- webhook via `POST /webhooks/github`
- polling via `integrations/poller.ts`

Tasks are deduplicated through source metadata and mapped from issue payloads.

### Manual

Tasks can be created from:

- the web UI
- `POST /api/tasks`
- `tangerine task create`

### Cross-Project

Other Tangerine tasks can prompt another task by calling `POST /api/tasks/:id/prompt` or by creating a new task with `source: "cross-project"`.

## Task Types

Current `type` values:

- `worker`
- `reviewer`
- `runner`

Capabilities are derived from type in `tasks/manager.ts`:

| Type | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| `worker` | `resolve`, `predefined-prompts`, `diff`, `continue`, `pr-track`, `pr-create` |
| `reviewer` | `resolve`, `predefined-prompts`, `diff`, `pr-track` |
| `runner` | `resolve`, `predefined-prompts`, `diff`, `continue` |

Unknown persisted task-type values normalize to `runner` for legacy compatibility. New task creation accepts only `worker`, `reviewer`, and `runner`.

## Lifecycle

```text
created -> provisioning -> running -> done
                                 -> failed
                                 -> cancelled
```

Additional flows:

- `failed` or `cancelled` -> retry creates a fresh task
- `running` -> restart recovery reconnects or resumes
- terminal tasks can be deleted after cleanup

## Start Flow

At a high level:

1. Read project config
2. Fetch repo state
3. Acquire or create a worktree slot
4. Create branch/worktree; reviewer tasks keep the PR source branch in `tasks.branch` for PR monitoring and check out a reviewer-local normal branch from that source (not detached HEAD) so they do not move an active worker branch ref
5. Start local ACP agent process for the chosen agent ID/provider field
6. Persist ACP session/process metadata
7. Stream events to logs and WebSockets

The implementation lives across:

- `tasks/lifecycle.ts`
- `tasks/retry.ts`
- `tasks/manager.ts`
- `tasks/worktree-pool.ts`

## Runtime Features

- prompt queue while the agent is busy
- idle suspension and later wake-up
- model/reasoning-effort/mode changes through ACP session config options
- PR detection and PR URL persistence
- last-seen and last-result timestamps
- parent/child task linkage

## Database Shape

Current `tasks` table fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  source TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_id TEXT,
  source_url TEXT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'worker',
  description TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'created',
  provider TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'acp', -- compatibility column storing configured ACP agent ID
  model TEXT,
  reasoning_effort TEXT,
  branch TEXT,
  worktree_path TEXT,
  pr_url TEXT,
  parent_task_id TEXT,
  user_id TEXT,
  agent_session_id TEXT,
  agent_pid INTEGER,
  suspended INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  error TEXT,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  started_at TEXT,
  completed_at TEXT,
  last_seen_at TEXT,
  last_result_at TEXT,
  capabilities TEXT,
  context_tokens INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  context_window_max INTEGER
)
```

Related tables:

- `session_logs` — `task_id`, `role`, optional `message_id`, `content`, `images`, `from_task_id`, `timestamp`; non-null `(task_id, role, message_id)` is unique so replayed assistant completions persist once
- `activity_log`
- `system_logs`
- `worktree_slots`
- `crons` — see `specs/crons.md`

## Cron-Spawned Tasks

Tasks with `source: "cron"` are regular workers spawned by the scheduler from cron records. They have `source_id: "cron:<cron_id>"` for linkage. The scheduler polls every 60 seconds and skips crons that already have an active task. See `specs/crons.md` for the full design.

## Worktree Isolation

Each running task operates inside its own worktree slot under the configured workspace. Worktree slots are tracked separately so Tangerine can reconcile stale state after crashes or restarts.

## Cleanup

Cleanup runs when tasks are:

- completed
- cancelled
- retried
- deleted
- detected as orphans

Cleanup responsibilities include:

- shutting down the agent handle if present
- removing worktrees
- clearing persisted worktree/process state

## Recovery

On startup, Tangerine resumes orphaned work:

- `created` and `provisioning` tasks are restarted from the beginning
- `running` tasks are reconnected through ACP `session/resume` or `session/load` when available; agents without resume/load start fresh and receive pending context

Health monitoring and reconnect locking prevent duplicate recovery loops.
